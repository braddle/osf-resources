# Static Code Analysis

## Prerequisites 

1. Install Java Version ???
2. Install [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)

## Activity

We are going to run [PMD](https://pmd.github.io/) a static Code Analysis tool over a small Java class.

To run PMD over you need to run the following command

```shell
mvn pmd:pmd
```

This produces an XML report that is then rendered into a HTML report as well.
